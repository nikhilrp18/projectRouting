            <p>A successful digitalization approach should be viewed more from a customer experience perspective than purely as a large process automation / IT modernization initiative. Digitalization is all about business simplification that helps to build self-sufficient business models for cost-effectiveness and consistent value. A successful digitalization initiative requires key ingredients like an aligned vision, prioritized goals, and a pragmatic digital-first approach for implementation with strong enablers and foundational elements.
